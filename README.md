TAMU please don't send me a cease and desist letter :(

# description
this is just meant for me to self host for my friends so each discord webhook has classes tied to it that we wish to track

storing professor names and course names in the json to avoid unnecessary requests, we just want the seat numbers

just works for spring 2025 (probably just modify for future semesters)

# setup
- install requirements from requirements.txt using `pip install -r requirements.txt` / your package manager
- modify config-example.json to have a discord webhook point to an array of sections
- rename config-example.json to config.json
- run the shell script to loop
